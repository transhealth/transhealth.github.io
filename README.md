About [trans.healthcare][self]
================

[trans.healthcare][self] is an open platform and information portal
for trans people seeking information relevant to transition and living
as trans.

Everything on this site is licensed under a 
[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License][cc-by-40]
unless otherwise specified.  Everyone is free to share and contribute to
the project, and no matter how popular it gets it will be free to use,
for everyone, forever.

Why are we doing this?
----------------------

There are many sites out there that claim to offer information on
these issues to the trans community.  In reality most of these
sites provide little to no help outside helping you find a surgeon
willing to perform <abbr title="Sexual Re-assignment Surgery">SRS</abbr>.
While this is certainly an important thing to know, this site will
focus on the fact that we are more than just our genitals.

The goal is to collect all information that is relevant to being 
trans.  Before, during, or after transition, regardless of your
gender identity, regardless of where you live.  This site should
provide the answers you seek and need.  And if you can't find 
the information you're looking for, [the site is completely open source][github], 
so you can suggest edits or volunteer to fill
in the gaps yourself if you want to.

Who are we?
-----------

trans.healthcare is developed and operated by a team of volunteers in
their spare time.  Most of us are trans ourselves, and know how hard it
can be to find information relevant to us and our needs.
