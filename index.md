    <span>Welcome to trans.healthcare,</span></h1>

    <p>
      the future home of an open platform and information portal
      for trans people seeking information relevant to transition.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're currently working hard at bringing together all the
      information needed to release the site into the wild. However,
      <a class="page-link" href="{{ 'index2.html' | prepend: site.baseurl }}">click here</a>
      if you feel like checking it out while we're working on it.
    </p>

    <h2>Why are we doing this?</h2>

    <p>
      There are many sites out there that claim to offer information on
      these issues to the trans community.  In reality most of these
      sites provide little to no help outside helping you find a surgeon
      willing to perform <abbr title="Sexual Re-assignment Surgery">SRS</abbr>.
      While this is certainly an important thing to know, this site will
      focus on the fact that we are more than just our genitals.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal is to collect all information that is relevant to being 
      trans.  Before, during, or after transition, regardless of your
      gender identity, regardless of where you live.  This site should
      provide the answers you seek and need.  And if you can't find 
      the information you're looking for, 
      <a href="https://github.com/transhealth/transhealth.github.io">the site is completely open source</a>, 
      so you can suggest edits or volunteer to fill
      in the gaps yourself if you want to.
